Description
SE workflow is increasingly fragmented, repetitive, and overloaded with administrative tasks. SEs juggle 5–10 active accounts at once, switching context while trying to deeply understand the customer's environment and craft the right solution narrative. Today, this work is highly manual, dependent on tribal knowledge, and prone to information loss across meetings, emails, and tools.

We carried out research to understand a day in the life of an SE. The workflow for an SE comprises of 3 broad steps

Understand customer requirements

Meetings with customers

Research public data (internet) & private data (Nutanix Cases, Helper, Saleforce)

Showcase Nutanix capabilities to customers

Product Capabilities & Architecture (Slides)

Product Demos (HPOC/RX environment)

Carry out technical steps to close a deal

Gather data - Nutanix Collector

Propose solutions - Nutanix Sizer (Quote & BOM)

By introducing an AI-powered SE Assistant, we can eliminate these operational inefficiencies and give SEs back their most valuable asset: time.

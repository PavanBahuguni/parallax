Title:
Add new column TCV to Sales Data (Opportunity detailed view page) for each opportunity.

Description:
- We have tcvAmount and tcvAmountUplifted on opportunity in database.
- We either show tcvAmount or tcvAmountUplifted in UI under TCV
- Resellers will always only see tcvAmountUplifted only, tcvAmount should be hidden from them
- Distributors will see tcvAmount in UI
